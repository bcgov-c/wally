Downloading geojson files
-------
Shell script to download geojson files from the Data Catalogue

```bash
$ bash download_geojson_info.sh <email_address_to_send_to>
``` 

Update the `geojson_request.json` for less, or more layers. With the current settings it takes around 4 hours to receive an email that your order is ready for download. It comes as a .zip file that's around 4GB
