The British Columbia Institute of Technology has operated a salmonid enhancement facility on the Seymour River since 1977.  In the past, emphasis has been placed on student training concerning fish culture with subsequent fry and smolt releases.  Little work has been done on habitat assessment and adult escapement estimates.  It has become apparent that existing knowledge of the status and biology of such populations is insufficient to enable appropriate management or enhancement on these stocks.  Funding was obtained through the Federal Job Development Program to carry out a one year project from February 1986 to 1987.  The objectives were to provide employment training for 10 long term unemployed people, gather baseline data concerning the temporal aspects of juvenile migration from the Seymour River, conduct intensive bioreconnaissance of the Seymour River and tributaries, estimate adult salmonid escapements and make relevant data available to DFO personnel.",

Key features of the upgraded intersection include a new partial diamond interchange and ramps, realignment of the existing Mountain Highway, widening the Highway 1 shoulders, reconfiguration of the existing Brooksbank Avenue Keith Road intersection, widening Keith Road at the Mountain Highway Brooksbank Avenue intersection, and enhancement of pedestrian and cycling connections along East Keith Road, Mountain Highway, and within District of North Vancouver parks. Approximately 681 square meter of stream habitat along Keith Creek will be lost when the project is commenced. Modification (diversion) of certain portions of Keith Creek was required for this project. Online background studies (iMapBC and Habitat Wizard) indicated that Keith Creek is a fish-bearing watercourse; consequently, fish salvages need to be conducted before instream work is commenced.",
