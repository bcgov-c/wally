# Data Mart - Meta Information

This application tracks data layer specific information and objects. 

## Outline

In the WALLY application we display contextual chart and text data based upon what layers and points a user selects. 
In order to display useful information, we need to map which columns from the data layer should be used to generate
the desired components.
